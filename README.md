# Cryptography-in-Java
Command line menu driven program which implements 25 classical ‘pen and paper’ ciphers in Java (BlueJ IDE).
<br>
The program can encrypt and decrypt text, with the option of a key depending on the cipher.
<br> 
Cryptography algorithms are modified by expanding them to incorporate the entire ASCII set for encoding, and not just the English Alphabet. 
<br>
It was submitted as part of my 10th standard ICSE Board Project in ‘Computer Science’.
